/* NOTICE: vendored by the revenexx skills catalog from
 * revenexx/studio-integrations@5e951a1, scripts/spec-check.mjs.
 *
 * Deviations from upstream — keep this list true when re-vendoring:
 *
 *   1. The failure summary pointed readers at `/spec-sync`, a slash command that
 *      exists in that repository and not in a repository the skill installs into. It
 *      now names the skill alone, which travels with the gate. The skill's four modes
 *      and `references/workflow.md` carry what the command carried.
 *   2. The `phpunit` adapter and its XML slicer are back, ported from
 *      revenexx/skills@8d933a1: claims are read from the `<groups>` block of
 *      `--list-tests-xml`. The slicer accepts `<tests>` and `<testSuite>` as the
 *      root, because PHPUnit has shipped either one and pinning one fails loudly on
 *      the other.
 *   3. A suite may name a `container` (with `workdir`, and the top-level `compose`),
 *      and its listing then runs through `docker compose exec -T`. `--native` forces
 *      every listing onto the host. Both come from the same upstream, which needed
 *      them because no container there mounts the docker socket.
 *   4. Suites sharing a `fileset` are two tiers over one set of test files, so the
 *      backward pass reads a claim from a sibling tier as extra proof rather than a
 *      mismatched level. Upstream achieved this by not checking the level per claim
 *      at all; doing it by declaration keeps the check for layers that really are
 *      separate.
 *   5. An unknown `adapter` reports as a config error, and an empty `suites` map says
 *      so once rather than calling every level unknown.
 *   6. A `go` adapter, which has no upstream: it reads `go test -json` and takes
 *      claims from the `attr` events `t.Attr("spec", "<feature>:AC-n")` emits (Go
 *      1.25+). It is the second adapter that reads a RUN rather than a listing, for
 *      the same reason the node:test reporter does — `go test -list` prints top-level
 *      function names and nothing else — and the first whose runner exposes a skip.
 */
/**
 * Feature-spec gate.
 *
 * Keeps the feature specs (what we promise — `specDir` in `spec.config.json`,
 * `specs/` here) and the test suites (what we verify) from drifting apart, in
 * BOTH directions:
 *
 *   forward   every AC with `verify: e2e|unit` has at least one test claiming it
 *             — a test that will not run does not count
 *   backward  every `@spec:<feature>:AC-n` tag in a test resolves to an AC that
 *             exists AND whose `verify:` names the suite it was found in — which
 *             may name more than one, for a promise proved at both levels
 *
 * The backward direction is the one that makes this sustainable: rewrite or
 * delete a promise and its tests go red immediately, so they have to be brought
 * along in the same change.
 *
 * Deliberately not a lint of the test sources: test claims are read from the
 * runners' own listings (`playwright test --list --reporter=json`,
 * `vitest list --json`), so no TypeScript is ever parsed here. That line was
 * tested and held in PO-213, which asked whether the AC-heading comment above a
 * test should be checked by scanning for it: a scan can prove a heading is
 * present but not that it is the RIGHT one, which is the whole value — so it
 * would trade a gap everybody can see for a green check that proves nothing. The
 * reason is recorded in the `feature-spec` skill, where the rule lives.
 *
 * It also answers a second question, and answers it as a report rather than as a
 * gate: `--since <ref>` says which promises were added, changed, retired or moved
 * between two points in this repository's history (PO-307). That mode parses the
 * corpus at both refs and nothing else — no format checks, no suite listing — and
 * always exits 0. It is a reading of the corpus, not a verdict on it: the two must
 * not be confused, because a gate that exits 0 proves something and this does not.
 *
 * Everything project-specific (paths, commands) is in `spec.config.json`.
 * Format rules: see the `feature-spec` skill.

 * cites specs by link, so before they were subtracted a bullet in any of them counted
 * as an inventory entry if a link happened to open it. The inventory cannot be
 * identified the other way round — positively, by naming the sections that ARE one —
 * because a corpus of any size groups its inventory under headings of its own and adds
 * to them, so that list would go stale on the next group and take the check with it.
 * What this cannot see is a renamed aside: it falls out of the list and is read as
 * inventory again, which is the old behaviour rather than a new failure. That is why

 * arrives as an event of its own, `{"Action":"attr","Test":…,"Key":"spec","Value":…}`
 * — so a Go test claims the way a Playwright test does rather than through its name.
 * Which is not a preference: `@` and `:` are not legal in a Go identifier, so a test
 * function CANNOT carry the tag in its name. A subtest can, and one that does is read
 * too, because the caller scans every title as well as every tag.
 *
 * The claim is the attribute VALUE, and it is the one place a `spec:` prefix is
 * optional: the key already said `spec`, so writing it twice is noise. `spec:` is
 * prepended before the value goes back to the caller, which is what makes it match
 * the same tag pattern as every other adapter.
 *
 * This adapter reads a RUN, not a listing, and three properties follow:
 *
 *   - `go test -list <re>` is not an option. It prints top-level test function names
 *     and nothing else: no subtests, no attributes. So enumeration costs a test run,
 *     the same trade the bundled node:test reporter makes.
 *   - **A failing claiming test takes the listing down with it** — `go test` exits
 *     non-zero, the gate reports the suite as unlistable, and coverage reads as
 *     UNKNOWN rather than absent. That is the honest reading: a promise whose own
 *     proof is red is not proven.
 *   - **The test cache is safe, and this was measured rather than assumed** (go1.27).
 *     A cached package replays its recorded events, attributes included, and editing
 *     a test invalidates its own package — so a claim can never be replayed out of a
 *     source that no longer carries it. `-count=1` on a suite's command is therefore
 *     about a live stack, never about this adapter.
 *
 * **A skip is visible here**, which no other adapter but `playwright` can say: the
 * terminal action for the test is `skip`, and it arrives after the attribute. So a
 * `verify:` line resting on a skipped Go test is caught by name instead of reading as
 * proven — worth knowing in a repository whose suites skip by design.
 *
 * `Package` stands in for the file, because test2json reports an import path and never
 * a path on disk. It is trimmed against the module path to the repo-relative directory.

/**
 * Two rules of the written form are checked here (PO-272), one outright and one
 * counted, and which is which follows from what the corpus already does. A third —
 * how long a `**Because**` may run — was tried as a count and dropped; see
 * `measureForm`.
 *
 * `verify:` closing its criterion is enforced, because every criterion in the
 * corpus already writes it there: the check pins a convention instead of asking for a reflow, so
 * there is nothing to migrate and no figure to keep. It was briefly the other way
 * round — `verify:` first, as the one machine-readable field — and moving every
 * criterion in the corpus to buy that bought nothing a reader wanted, so the rule
 * ended up naming where they already were.
 *
 * The gap labels arrived after the specs did, and enforcing them would fail every
 * spec at once and force a single commit rewriting every `## Gaps` section in the
 * corpus — unreviewable, and guaranteed to collide with whatever specs are in
 * flight. Leaving them unchecked was the other option, and the reason not to take
 * it is written in the ticket: an unchecked rule drifts exactly like the
 * frontmatter field the gate had to learn to validate.
 *
 * So that one is a ratchet. The count is pinned in the config and must match
 * exactly: adding a violation fails, and so does removing one without lowering
 * the number. The second half is the point — it keeps the figure equal to
 * reality instead of to whenever somebody last looked, and it makes the debt a
 * line in a file people read rather than a habit nobody measures.

  // they deserve — they are three notes in one section, not three sections. A bold

  // `## Gaps`. It never fitted: an entry naming the spec that DOES promise
  // something is a promise kept, and nesting it under a heading meaning "missing"
  // said the opposite at every read — which a definition in the skill cannot undo,
  // because the reader of a spec never opens the skill. Dropping it from this set
  // is what makes the old shape fail instead of quietly returning.

  // Every such paragraph in the corpus said one of two things — what the section
  // is, or that an entry needs somebody to confirm the intent — and both of those
  // are now carried by the heading and by the `**Undecided**` label. Before the
  // labels existed the prose had to do that work, which is why 22 of 38 specs grew
  // one, in fourteen different phrasings of the same sentence.
  //
  // "Only when it says something the labels cannot" was the other candidate rule and

  // reads as an intro — that an existing AC covers part of the gap, that everything
  // below waits on one ticket — goes in the entry it is about, where it travels with
  // that entry instead of standing above a section that will grow others.
  // An `## Elsewhere` entry names a promise another spec keeps, and the link to that
  // spec is the whole payload: the section's value is that a reader may stop looking
  // there, so an entry pointing at nothing spends exactly that and leaves a gap
  // reading as covered. Checked here rather than left to judgement because the
  // section attracts this failure — 21 of the corpus's 26 entries were written as

 * Every criterion reference a spec writes, not only the ones in `**Pair**` bullets.
 *
 * A spec that tells its reader "the promise is `other.md` AC-1" while that criterion
 * was retired sends them to a line that no longer exists, and the gate owned the
 * machinery to catch it long before it looked here: two such references sat green in
 * the corpus for a month (PO-282).
 *
 * **The form is strict, and that is the point.** A cross-spec reference is
 * `[other.md](other.md) AC-n` — the ids that follow such a link, including a run of
 * them joined by "and", a comma, or a range ("AC-15 to AC-18", where the endpoints are
 * what gets resolved), belong to that spec; every other id on the line is
 * this spec's own. The looser reading — a link retargets everything after it until the
 * end of the line — is what the `**Pair**` resolver does inside a single bullet, where
 * a note is one sentence about one pair. Applied to prose it misreads a paragraph that
 * links a sibling, closes the sentence and then talks about its own criterion, which
 * is exactly how one of this corpus's paragraphs reads. Requiring the shape is the
 * same move the resolver below already made once when it chose the href over the link
 * text: make it exact rather than nearly right.
 *
 * Two kinds of line are statements *about* a retirement rather than references to it,
 * and both are exempt: the retirement line itself, and everything under `## Tickets`,
 * where the history of a promise is kept on purpose.

 * either order the id sits outside the strict form above, so it is read as this spec's

 * resolves happily against ours and nothing is said. That is the PO-282 case exactly,

 *
 * Naming no criterion at all is fine: a pair note may say that a criterion's own two
 * halves control each other, which names nothing to resolve.
 *
 * An id belongs to the spec named nearest before it, which is how a person reads the

 * sibling's retired `AC-4` resolved happily against this spec's own `AC-4` and the one
 * rot the check exists for went unreported.
 *
 * The href names the spec, not the link text. Keying on the text meant only one shape
 * of link retargeted anything — `[node-inspector.md](node-inspector.md)`, which the
 * corpus happens to write — while `[the node inspector](node-inspector.md)`, the way
 * one would normally write it, left the scope silently on this spec and resolved a
 * sibling's ids against our own. That is the same silent failure the paragraph above
 * rejects "either file" for, reintroduced by the shape of the syntax rather than by
 * the rule. A link to anything that is not a bare sibling filename — `../docs/x.md` —
 * is deliberately no spec and leaves the scope alone; the sibling-link check holds
 * spec links to that bare form.
